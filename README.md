# Spying-On-Cows 
The project also aims to make an effective machine learning predictive model from a herd and cow perspective and explains what attributes are used in both.
 
This project implements databases, machine learning models, and Explainable artificial intelligence, to detect lameness effectively while showing how it classifies lameness. It looks at this problem from data of the individual cows and the herd data as a whole, to compare how these models predict lameness. It also sees how changes will affect both strategies.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Modern dairy farms generate large volumes of behavioral and health data from individual cows. This project addresses the challenges of handling and interpreting this big data by:

- Creating a robust, clean, and consistent dataset from heterogeneous real-world sensor logs
- Building two parallel ML pipelines: one using **individual cow models**, and the other using **herd-level aggregation**
- Applying **oversampling**, **grid search**, **cross-validation**, and **XAI (LIME)** to explore model performance
- Comparing the strengths and limitations of each approach from both herd and individual perspectives
- 
## 🔍 What This Project Demonstrates

- Development of a custom ML pipeline for predictive health monitoring.
- Data integration from multiple sources and timeframes.
- Use of ensemble learning and hierarchical modeling techniques.
- Interpretability of model predictions using LIME.
- Skills in MySQL, Python, Java, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.


## 📌 Key Results

- **Oversampling improved** individual cow model performance but **degraded** herd model performance
- LIME revealed **distinct feature importance** patterns across individual vs. herd models
- Demonstrated potential for **stacked ensemble models** or **hierarchical modeling** to combine both perspectives
- Identified novel predictive features and confirmed domain-specific ones (e.g., cow movement, water trough behavior)

## 🧠 Skills & Techniques

- Deep Learning (ANN/DNN)
- Oversampling (SMOTE)
- Ensemble Learning / Bagging-inspired strategies
- Explainable AI (LIME)
- Data Cleaning, Aggregation & Wrangling
- Tools: Python, Java, MySQL, Excel, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch
